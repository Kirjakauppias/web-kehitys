<H1>Basic HTML Animals</H1>

<P>This is the first paragraph in our page. It introduces our animals.</P>

<h2>The Llama</h2>

<P>Our Llama is a big fan of list items. When she spies a patch of them on a web page, she will eat them like sweets, licking her lips as she goes.</P>

<H2>The Anaconda</H2>

<p>The crafty anaconda likes to slither around the page, travelling rapidly by way of anchors to sneak up on his prey.</p>
